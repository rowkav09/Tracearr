/**
 * Library Watch Statistics Route
 *
 * GET /watch - Per-item watch counts and watched/unwatched ratios
 *
 * Joins library_items with sessions table to provide:
 * - Watch count per item
 * - Total watch time per item
 * - Last watched timestamp
 * - Summary with watched/unwatched ratio
 *
 * Single-server path: counts are per library_items row, no external-ID dedup —
 * matches main branch behavior exactly.
 *
 * Multi-server path: titles are collapsed by media identity (media_id, falling back
 * to the item id) so the same movie on two servers counts as ONE title in the summary
 * KPIs and in the Most Watched list. Watch events (plays, duration) are SUMMED across
 * servers.
 *
 * Uses LEFT JOIN to ensure items without sessions return 0 watch count.
 * A play is one resume chain (COALESCE(reference_id, id)) gated at 2 minutes (120000ms).
