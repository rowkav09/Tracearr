 *   key has no non-container library item pointing at a non-container media row
 *   are excluded so they never re-select.
 * - Show-link repair: sessions that already have media_id but were stamped before
 *   their media row's show_media_id existed (e.g. the show synced later). Re-running
 *   this is safe - a repaired session no longer matches either pass's WHERE clause.
 * - Container unlink: sessions linked to a show, season, artist or album media row
 *   lose their media and provider ids. The fresh stamp refuses container items, so
 *   an unlinked session is never stamped back onto one.

 * The optional started_at window is what keeps this survivable on a compressed
 * hypertable: one transaction per chunk bounds tuple decompression to a single
 * chunk's segments. The per-transaction cap is lifted inside that bound - a
 * busy month-chunk decompresses more tuples than the 100k default even for a
 * 10k-row batch, and tripping the cap turns the walk into a fail-retry loop.
 * The window is the memory guard, not the cap; an unwindowed batch with the
 * cap disabled globally is what once ballooned until the OOM killer took
 * postgres down.
