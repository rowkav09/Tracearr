/**
 * Kill Queue Re-verification
 *
 * Re-checks a matched kill_stream condition against current state right
 * before the delayed termination fires. delay_seconds is the sustain window
 * between the original match and this check, so a session that stopped or a
 * condition that cleared in the meantime must abort rather than kill on
 * stale evidence. Builds its evaluation context through the same seams live
 * rule evaluation uses (excludeUncountableSessions, gracePeriodSessionIds,
 * evaluateRulesAsync) so re-verification and live evaluation can never
 * disagree about what counts as an active session.
 *
 * A kill job carries two session ids. The TRIGGER is the session whose match
 * produced the kill; its context (user, server, media, geo, identity,
 * recentSessions) is what the rule matched on, so re-verification rebuilds the
 * evaluation context from the trigger. The TARGET is the session actually
 * terminated - for target: 'triggering' the two are the same, but multi-target
 * (oldest/newest/all_*) and enforceAcrossServers kills point the target at a
 * different session, possibly on another server or account, whose own context
 * never matched the rule. Re-verifying against the target instead of the
 * trigger loses those kills and, for serverId/serverUserId-scoped
 * enforceAcrossServers rules, self-aborts every time on the scope check. The
 * target still owns the already-stopped short-circuit and the termination call.
 *
 * The cache is not a faithful stand-in for "current state" for the triggering
 * session specifically: createSessionWithRulesAtomic skips re-adding it to the
 * cache once a kill job is enqueued for it (wasTerminatedByRule), so at
 * delay_seconds 0 this can run before any poll tick rediscovers it. The context
 * and target sessions are appended back into the count context only when
 * genuinely uncached (absent from the RAW cache list), never when
 * excludeUncountableSessions dropped them for being grace-flagged or pending -
 * live evaluation would exclude those too, so resurrecting them here would
 * count phantoms the live path never would.
 *
 * A multi-target match fans out one kill job per target, all sharing one
 * violation id. A sibling stopped BY THIS violation is ACTION REACH, not the
 * condition genuinely clearing, so it must not weaken the condition for its
 * still-pending siblings. Two effects are undone: (a) when the trigger itself
 * was the sibling stopped under this violation (its termination log carries the
 * violation id and forceStopped is set), it is treated as still-present and the
 * context is rebuilt as-at-trigger from its row rather than aborting; (b) every
 * session terminated under this violation is folded back into the count context
 * so a threshold like concurrent_streams does not drop below its limit as
 * siblings die. A genuine trigger loss (user stopped it, no rule termination
 * log tying the stop to this violation) still aborts.
